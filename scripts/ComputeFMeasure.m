function [Results]=ComputeFMeasure(DBpath,SegResultsSubPath,SysType)
%Compute the F-score for a single segment
%Syntax:
%       [Results]=ComputeFMeasure(DBpath,SegResultsSubPath,SysType)
%Input:
%       DBpath - The directory of the entire evaluation Database
%       SegResultsSubPath - The name of the sub-directory  in which the results of
%                           the algorithm to be evaluated  are placed.
%       SysType - The type of system in use, this determines the path
%       separation char.There are two optional values 'win' or 'unix' if no value is
%                 specified the default is set to 'win'.
%Output:
%       Results - An 100X3 matrix where Results(i,1) holds the best F-score for a single segment.
%                 Results(i,2) and Results(i,3) holds the corresponding Recall and Precision scores.
%       Example:
%                 [Results]=ComputeFMeasure('c:\Evaluation_DB','MyRes','pc');
